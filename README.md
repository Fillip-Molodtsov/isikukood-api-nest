## Prerequisites
A Postgres instance running with a created database (can be specified in the .env file).

Before launching the app, please add "src/common/envs/development.env" file
with the info specified in the template. 

DB in this project is needed to persist the count of same gender people born in the same day.

For this project, the logic of assigning the ordinal number was simplified to giving an increment according to the counter.
